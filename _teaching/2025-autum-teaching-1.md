Assisted in marking coursework.

Helped mark the websiteâ€™s design by identifying if the correct structure and semantics were used in HTML and efficiently utilising appropriate CSS rules and selectors. Higher grade marks had to showcase an outstanding website with material not taught within the module, for example, using front-end frameworks such as React.js or back-end frameworks such as Django.
