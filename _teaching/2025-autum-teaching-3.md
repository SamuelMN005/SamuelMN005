Assisted in marking coursework.

Helped mark coursework in which, using NoSQL, students had to design their database (the design had to be an embedded database based on a given database). Furthermore, students had to design queries to search for specific data within the database and compare the queries against the original database to test the performance. Finally, students designed specific queries to search for specific data on a NeoJ4 implementation of a given database.
