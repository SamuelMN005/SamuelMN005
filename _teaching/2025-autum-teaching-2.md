Assisted in marking coursework.

Helped mark two coursework. The first coursework assessed a static website requiring implementing three HTML pages with appropriate styling in CSS, a 2x3 table and a clickable picture. For the second coursework, they had to implement a dynamic website, in which they had to create an HTML page with appropriate styling in CSS, allowing the user to provide input and format the output. To process the input, a Python script using the CGI library had to be created to process the input, and the selected format for the output had to be generated in HTML with appropriate styling.
