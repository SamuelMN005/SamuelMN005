Emotional exhaustion and high burden levels affect the wellbeing of Informal Caregivers. Different technologies explore how to support better their carer tasks and their wellbeing. In this paper, we present the deployment of a system that will track burden levels and emotion analysis using a social robot. We describe two systems; the first system integrates multi-modal emotional analysis using visual and voice inputs. The second system is based on a multi-modal emotional analysis using visual, voice inputs and touch-screen interaction. Based on the information detected, the system analyses emotions and activates the pick-and-place movement associated with the emotions identified. Future work will include participatory design sessions and evaluations with social care workers, and informal and formal caregivers to improve the interactions with social robots in the informal care context.

It was a pleasure to talk to all attendees. Although, to my acknowledgement, the workshop does not contain inproceedings, please feel free to download the paper and read it.
