As we enter 2025, passing the EOL of Gazebo Classic, a new simulation for the Stretch robot (developed by Hello Robot Inc.) is needed. In 2021, PickNik Robotics migrated the robot into Ignition Gazebo. However, since the migration of the robot into Ignition Gazebo, significant differences have been made in newer versions of the simulator. Within this presentation, Cardiff Computational Robotics Team (CUCR) would like to present the latest migration of the Stretch robot tested for Gazebo Sim Harmonic. We will provide a deeper explanation of how it differs from previous open-source migrations into ROS2, examples of how to utilize the robot in simulation and a list of possible projects to do with this simulator.
